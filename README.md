## Understanding Check

1. For the Recipe Card project, I would manually run automated tests before pushing code, just to make sure that my code is fully functional before I track it in the remote branch. That way, I don't have to push code first before realizing that I missed a test or have some bug in functionality, saving me from making a million different commits and pushes to fix the issue.
2. Yes, since user actions trigger functions that produce some result and may return values. In that case, end to end testing, which emulates user actions and checks to see that the desired outcomes are produced, can be used to check if functions are reutrning correctly.
